<p>I'm a front-end web developer who's been coding since 2013. I graduated May 2019 from Rutgers University with a B.A. in Information Technology and Informatics, and I currently work full-time as a web producer for Amplity Health. I don't freelance.</p>

<p>Besides making websites, I also love learning languages. As a multilingual Cuban-American, I'm fluent in Spanish and English and have studied German since middle school and French since high school. I'm currently also studying Polish and Italian. Some of my other interests are drawing and researching niche topics.</p>
<p>My birds and my partner are my happiness.&nbsp;â™¡</p>
